# Yet another command line argument parser

I've created this project just as an excuse to test a few libraries, including [`poetry`](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry), [`pytype`](https://github.com/google/pytype) and some new configurations for [`coc.nvim`](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim).

The idea for the project comes from "Clean Code". To be clear, this is a pretty useless library. As such, I wouldn't recommend anyone to use it.
